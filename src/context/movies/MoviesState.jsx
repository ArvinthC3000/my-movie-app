        "Anxious to use artificial life to improve the world, Rosetta Stone, a bio-geneticist creates a Recipe for Cyborgs and uses her own DNA in order to breed three Self Replicating Automatons, part human, part computer named Ruby, Olive and Marine. The SRA's act as 'portals' on the Internet, helping users to fulfill their dreams. The SRA's are nourished through touch. Because they were bred only with Rosetta's DNA, they need the balance of an Y chromo or male sperm to survive. Rosetta projects seduction scenes from movie clips onto Ruby, which absorbs as she sleeps. The SRA'S can not distinguish dreams from reality. Ruby acts out these scenes in real life with the men and shares her spoils with her sisters. However, Ruby's encounters suffer from impotence and unexplained rashes. Fearing a bio-gender war, the FBI sends in Agent Edward Hopper to solve the mystery. Puzzled, he turns for help from a private cyber detective. The men recover. Ruby falls in love and becomes impregnated by Sandy, a xerox shop worker. The characters struggle to find love in a world that no longer needs sex to reproduce, a world that is changing and is populated with people who use provisional identities and are seen through virtual selves and a world where love is the only thing that makes things real. \u2014wayne@wildstrawberryfilms.com",

      summary:
        "Tenley Sweeney is a San Francisco based horticulturalist with a focus on sustainability. Afraid to put herself out romantically, she has long had a crush on Jared Carr since they met on an online sustainability forum a year ago - his focus on reducing plastics - they never yet having met in person. Urged by her best friend and roommate Cami to take a chance, Tenley does ask Jared out for an in-person date, he agreeing to meet for coffee. When he ends up standing her up, she learns the reason is that he was involved in a bicycle accident en route to their meeting, he in the hospital unconscious with a concussion. In the rush to be by his side, Tenley, at the hospital, is unaware until after the fact not only that the hospital mistook her for Jared's wife, but that she signed the consent form for them to continue treatment, which ended up saving his life. In this confusion, she is also mistaken as his wife by his family: his parents Lynn and Ronnie, his two teenage sisters Betsey and Faye, and his best friend and business partner Everett. The harder she tries to tell them the truth, the more reasons arise that prevent her from doing so. While the Carrs as a collective welcome Tenley into their family, Everett is suspicious of this new woman in their lives, namely why Jared never would have mentioned her let alone that they are married. The latest obstacle in telling them the truth is they needing her sustainability expertise in Jared's place to save his and Everett's start-up business - Jared who handles the sustainability side, Everett the financial side - and which Lynn and Ronnie have mortgaged their house to help. Beyond continuing the ruse, the problem for Tenley in spending concentrated time with Everett becomes their increasing mutual attraction. \u2014Huggo",

        'A story told quietly of Vincent a welder at a large and seemingly toxic plant along the Rh\u00f4ne, living in a village with his sons, wife, and mother, saying little to each other. Vincent paints; some of what he sees is artifice. The sounds are of trains, boats, factory horns, and people singing. Men watch women, sometimes priests join in the looking, sometimes not. A crocodile appears in a garden. With money his father gives him, Vincent takes a journey to Venice. He sees the city from a roof top, the view is a gift from a friend. One of his sons hang-glides with a girl friend. Vincent comes home to go back to work. What is it to taste wine and to be alive? \u2014',
